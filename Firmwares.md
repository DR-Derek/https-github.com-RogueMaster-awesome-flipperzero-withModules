</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Staying up to date with upstream (official) firmware is important.</li>
    <li>TX restriction removal is illegal in most circumstances, use at your own risk.</li>
    <li>RogueMaster is more focused on visual tweaks, new items, and changes (some experimental).</li>
    <li>RogueMaster is based on Unleashed and OFW and keeps up to date on both on a daily basis.</li>
    <li>Unleashed is more focused on core functionality, stability, and Sub-GHz protocols.</li>
    <li>SquachWare is forked from OFW, adding lots of custom stuff to play with out of the box all while retaining the securities and comfort of OFW.</li>
